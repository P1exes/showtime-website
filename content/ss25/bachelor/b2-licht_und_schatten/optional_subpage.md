We had the idea, way before the semester began. The development started after we
were officially put together into a team of seven.
During development, we utilized weekly meetings to organize the team and
upcoming tasks. These meetings helped us to get to know each other and discuss
the game's current status. Additionally, we had one extra weekly meeting with Prof.
Lenz to show him our current progress. There he was able to stress-test the game
and find missing game-mechanics as well as all absent object-colliders. (He is
phenomenal at this!) We used these insights to plan and distribute our weekly goals
and tasks.

We divided our team into two sub-groups: art and programming. The art team was
tasked with creating concept art, assets, model, textures, materials and laying out as
well as designing levels. Meanwhile, the programming team was responsible for
implementing AI, level loading systems, and core game logic. However, these roles
were flexible - team members were encouraged to collaborate across teams with
one another and to test out different design-approaches. This allowed programmers
to contribute to art tasks and artists to support programming when needed.
Due to the topic of our game being "light and shadows" we spend a lot of time testing
out different light-setups inside Unity's virtual environment. In addition, we modelled
and textured many of the game's assets ourselves to better fit the overall
atmosphere we created.
